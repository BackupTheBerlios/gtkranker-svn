FUNC:
- decide on how to store xml/html result files

  They should somehow be sortable without reading every one of them. 
  The reason being that I want to compare results to previous results, 
  and I want the previous xml file fast.

  Should the xml files have xsl info, or should I generate html from the 
  xml + xslt files? Anyhow, I have to store the data in xml, so i can't 
  delete that after generating html, so i end up with a huge results 
  directory with both html and xml files for the same data.

  If I use xsl info in the xml file, where do i get the xslt from, for 
  now only the home/.gtkranker dir?

- check at startup if there is a configuration dir, if not, create one 
(move code from the configuration class). Add some sort of dialog or 
wizard to ask for a google key.

- Also check for the existence of a websites file and create some sort 
of wizard to create a website

- create a nicer looking xslt file

- move to separate threads for the querying

- Show differences with previous query's
  how? will I store 1 previous result in an attribute

- Add a tab with previous results.
  How to collect previous results? Add them all to a dataset and write that 
  to a temporary file? xsl file with multiple xml sources?....

- Add saturation (number of pages in engine)

UI:
- Add a tab behind results that allows you to configure the website

- For now only far less buttons are needed on top. I think of 
 - add site (call the website wizard)
 - execute
 - about
 - maybe help, though that's not gonna do something for a while

- make the about button work (how??)
