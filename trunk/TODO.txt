FUNC:
- decide on how to store xml/html result files
- check at startup if there is a configuration dir, if not, create one 
(move code from the configuration class). Add some sort of dialog or 
wizard to ask for a google key.
- Also check for the existence of a websites file and create some sort 
of wizard to create a website
- create a nicer looking xslt file

UI:
- Add a tab behind results that allows you to configure the website
- For now only far less buttons are needed on top. I think of 
 - add site
 - execute
 - about
 - maybe help, though that's not gonna do something for a while
