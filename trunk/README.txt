gtkRanker

1. What is gtkRanker?
---------------------
gtkRanker is a tool to check the ranking of your website in google for the keywords you select.


2. How does it work?
--------------------
It's written in c# (mono) and gtk#. It should eventually, probably (;)) run on more than one platform.
It uses the google API to retrieve results, and as a consequense requires a google key.
Once it has the results it stores them as an XML file and uses an .xsl to show the results.
